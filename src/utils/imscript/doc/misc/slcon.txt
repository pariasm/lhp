PROPOSAL FOR SLCON 2016
-----------------------

TITLE: Suckless Image Processing

ABSTRACT:
An image is an array of numbers.  Since arrays of numbers are
natively represented in C, this language is well-suited for image
processing algorithms.  Moreover, many complex image processing
algorithms are often pipelines of simple, independent steps.  Thus,
the UNIX programming environment is an ideal platform for image
processing, where several simple programs written in C share
information through UNIX pipes.  In this talk, we will see many
examples of simple image processing utilities (blur, local maxima
detection, interpolation, warping, pointwise algebraic expressions,
morphological filters, block matching, optical flow, image fusion)
and how they are naturally combined to perform advanced image
techniques;  in the selected example, an show object removal
technique based on the combination of several images.  An important
issue, with far-reaching philosophical consequences, is the data
format written through the pipes.  We explain why the farbfeld image
format---proposed by the suckless community---is inappropriate in
general, because of the need to represent negative and floating-point
pixel values.
