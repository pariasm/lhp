This repository has too many programs.  There are a few important,
"core" programs intermingled with dozens of silly, irrelevant or very
specific utils.

This file gives a list of the relevant programs.


CORE: generic tools for image processing

	plambda:  apply an expression with images as variables
	blur:     convolution by a positive kernel
	downsa:   zoom out
	upsa:     zoom in
	ntiply:   replicate pixels
	crop:     extract a sub-image
	fft/iift: discrete fourier transform of an image, and its inverse
	dct:      discrete cosine transform of an image (self-inverse)
	dht:      discrete hartley transform of an image (self-inverse)
	imprintf: print info and statistics of an image
	fontu:    overlay a text in an image
	veco:     accumulate values over a list of gray images
	vecov:    accumulate values over a list of multispectral images
	morsi:    elementary gray-level morphological operations
	simpois:  poisson and bilaplacian iterative solvers
	imgerr:   compare two images (obsoleted by plambda+imprintf)
	qeasy:    quantize an image into [0,255], hand-selected saturation
	qauto:    quantize an image into [0,255], automatic saturation
	iion:     copy (useful for converting between formats)


NO-CORE: more specific tasks

	tiffu:    various mini-utils for dealing with TIFF files
	siftu:    various mini-utils for dealing with sift points
	ransac:   compute robust models from data points
	srmatch:  successive multi-scale matching of sift keypoints
	amle:     infinity-laplacian equation
	nnint:    nearest-neighbor interpolation
	bdint:    boundary aggregation interpolation
	elap:     laplace interpolation (mostly obsoleted by simpois)
	distance: image of distances to a set of points
	deframe:  projective crop (defined by 4 points in the image)
	cdeint:   deinterlace a video frame


FLOW: utils for producing or transforming vector fields

	synflow:    generate a parametric synthetic vector field
	backflow:   warp an image by a vector field
	flowinv:    compute the inverse vector field
	flowdiv:    compute the divergence of a vector field

VIS: utils for data visualization

	viewflow:   color code for a vector field
	flowarrows: display a vector field using arrows
	ghisto:     gray-level histogram (to be piped to gnuplot)
