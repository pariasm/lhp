This subdirectory contains an implementation of the "optical_flow" function as
required by the centroid method.  The implementation consists of three files:

pyramidal_horn_schunck.c:
	The multiscale Horn-Schunck implementation by SÃ¡nchez, Meinhardt and
	Koenderman, copied directly from the IPOL publication.

smooth_inpainting.c:
	A simple multiscale solver for Poisson equation.

optical_flow.c:
	An implementation of the function "optical_flow".  It computes
	the Horn-Schunck optical flow, and then smoothens its discontinuities
	using Poisson equation.  From the point of view of the centroid
	method, the discontinuities of the optical flow are undesirable
	because they tend to produce artifacts in the reconstructed images.
